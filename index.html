        <h3>Friends Not To The End</h3>
        <p class="indent">Second grade, I have no friends and my cousin isn’t in my grade anymore. He got held back so I now have no one to play with. There was an after school program at my elementary school that my mom signed me up for because she couldn’t pick me up after school when the bell rang. I believe she had work or went to school so she couldn’t pick me up. The afterschool program was called A.S.A. (After School Academy) and the teachers worked in the program or they worked both in the program and as a lunch monitor during the school day. The teachers who worked as a lunch monitor were closer to the students because they talked with them during lunch. I wasn’t close to the teachers because I couldn’t talk to anyone.</p>
        <p class="indent">It was cold and I just wanted to go home. I was in ASA and in the back corner of the room while the teacher was introducing themselves. I wasn’t paying attention thinking about playing games when I got home. I feel a tap on my right shoulder.</p>
        <p class="indent">“What’s your name?”</p>
        <p class="indent">I looked at the person wanting my attention. I didn’t know anyone and I certainly didn’t know the person talking to me. This was the first day of ASA and I didn’t know what to do so I just said my name.</p>
        <p class="indent">“My name is Kyle,” I replied.</p>
        <p class="indent">“My name is Dillian,” he said.</p>
        <p class="indent">I didn’t really talk much to him but he was talking a lot to me. It felt nice to have someone that talks to me and I wasn’t lonely anymore. The next day during lunch I looked for him and we played with each other during lunch. I looked forward to everyday at school just to play with him. He made more friends in ASA in our class and we got a friend group. Me and Dillian stuck together and we would look for each other at lunch. He would play basketball and I would join him even though I sucked at it. It was just fun to play with him and not be alone anymore. We only had 4th grade class together but it didn’t stop us from being friends.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Kyle, do you want to do cross country with me?” Dillian said to me.</p>
        <p class="indent">“No, I don’t want to run the mile,” I replied.</p>
        <p class="indent">That was something I didn’t follow him on but he left Fridays for games and he looked like he was having fun. I joined him in wrestling during the fall season to do it with him. I wasn’t really good but at least after practice was over we would both go to ASA together. Then in the spring we did track. We both made the team on the 200 meters which is the length of half of the track. Of course I wasn’t wasn’t that good at running but I made it and me and Dillian both went to Clovis High track on Friday. We wanted to go to the snack bar and get stuff so we asked one of the coaches if our event was coming close.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Mrs.(I forgot her name) is the 200 meters run event coming up,” I said.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Ummm, I don’t think so,” She replied.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Ok thx Mrs.(I don’t blame her),” I said.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Dillian she said that our event wasn’t coming up so lets go to the snack bar,” I said to Dillian.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Ok let’s go Kyle,” Dillian replied to me.</p>
        <p class="indent">The coach was chilling in their chairs they brought so they probably didn’t know what was happening. There were lots of people from all the schools and lots of people in the middle where people were getting numbers for their events. Me and Dillian went to get money from our backpacks and we went to the snack bar for the first time. We bought some stuff and came back to see people lining up at the 200 meter run line but we didn’t think much of it. I got a little worried but me and Dillian just went to our bags and put our stuff away. We both went to the middle where participants check in and it turned out that the people running were the other 200 meters runners and we missed our events. Well we both knew that we both knew what was going to happen next. On Monday when we went to track practice they gathered the people in track and told them the results of the game Friday. After that we were told by a coach that we were kicked off the team because there was no record of us doing our event and they said that we were playing around. Me and Dillian both went to ASA early that day. The teachers wondered why we came back earlier than usual and with the other students in the class. We both didn’t want to tell them what happened but we said that we were kicked off the team. I didn’t do track 5th grade year but I did it 6th grade since everyone in ASA was wondering why I wasn’t doing track again. After 4th grade Dillian became more of a quiet kid and I had to be more social because we still were best buddies. He would only talk to certain people like me and I think this was because of the event we had at track.</p>
        <p class="indent">Middle school Dillian went back to being social and he made friends easily. I didn’t know how to talk to people so I stuck with him. Me and Dillian started to slowly drift away from each other because we didn’t have any classes together even though it didn’t stop us from being friends before it was now. He was making friends with people I didn’t know but I still hung out with him. We had the same PE period which helped a little bit but I could see that we were starting to change into a boy fit for Clark. I didn’t like that person he was turning into so I just slowly stopped hanging out with. I was truly alone at that point since I knew no one else to talk to or hangout with. All my old friends went back to Dillian so I didn’t go to them. I went to Porter’s group which was behind the snack bar by the basketball courts where I hung out for a bit but I couldn’t connect with anyone there.</p>
        <p class="indent">After that I just gave up on hanging out with anyone and walked around alone during lunch looking at the ground for quarters mainly but coins to buy stuff for free at the snack bar. I liked the 50 cent cookies and I was getting it for free anyway so that’s how I spent my lunch till some friends invited me. My elective for Clark was supposed to be exploring technology but a new class had been made that year and one exploring technology class was swapped to the broadcasting class.</p>
        <p class="indent">“Kyle, do you want to hang out with us in the library,” said Isaiah.</p>
        <p class="indent">“I have nothing to do at lunch so sure,” I said to Isaiah.</p>
        <p class="indent">Isaiah invited me to hang out with him and his friend Adrian at lunch at the library so I won’t be alone during lunch anymore. We hung out in the library and that’s how we spent our lunch together.</p>
        <p class="indent">To this day Isaiah and Adrian don’t hang out anymore for some reason and I don’t hang out with them too but I had a good time in 7th grade and they had a good time in 8th grade.</p>
